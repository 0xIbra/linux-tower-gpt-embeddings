# Linux Tower - GPT embeddings experiment


[**Linux Tower**](https://github.com/0xIbra/linux-tower) is a web interface designed for server application management and monitoring, focusing on applications such as Apache, NGINX, and Certbot. It provides features like application monitoring, alerting, and custom log alerts.

## Technologies

Linux Tower is built using:
- Python 3: For the backend, Flask-based API.
- Vue: For the frontend.

## Current Status

Currently, the project has implemented various API endpoints for interacting with server applications. For example, the Apache API has endpoints to fetch the status and metrics of an Apache server if it's installed and running. Other server applications are expected to have similar endpoints.

## Experiment with GPT and Code Embeddings

This project is a work-in-progress and serves as an experiment for context injection with GPT and code embeddings.  
The goal is to use GPT to develop the remaining features of the project.

As this is an experimental approach, it's unclear what the results will be. The project could end up being a success, demonstrating the potential of GPT and code embeddings in software development. On the other hand, it could also highlight the limitations of this approach.
